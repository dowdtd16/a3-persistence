-The goal of the application was to expand upon the previous application by adding various middleware software to enhance the user experience.

-The challenges I faced during this assignment was that I found express difficult to work with causing many issues.

-I choose to do local authentication as this was something I found very difficult. I used google firebase as my database because I had used it before and had experience with it.

-I modified the color scheme of the bootstrap framework so that it would fit the boat theme as well as being 508 complient.

- I used passport with the local strategy for the authentication but ran into many issues trying to get it to work. I attempted to use Morgan to return a token of a timestamp whenever they add a row, so they can track when each workout happened.
I added helmet to add sequrity to the appilication.
